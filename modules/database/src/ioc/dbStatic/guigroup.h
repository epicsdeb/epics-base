#error As of Base 3.15.4, the promptgroup implementation has changed. \
    This header file (guigroup.h) is invalid and will be removed shortly. \
    Instead, you should include dbStaticLib.h, parse the DBD, \
    and use dbGetPromptGroupNameFromKey() and dbGetPromptGroupKeyFromName() \
    that have been added to dbStaticLib. \
    More details in the 3.15.4 release notes and the AppDev Guide.
