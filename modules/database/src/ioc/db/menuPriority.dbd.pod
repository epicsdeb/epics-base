=head1 Menu menuPriority

This menu is used for the C<PRIO> field of all record types. It controls
the relative priority of records scheduled with C<SCAN=Event> or
C<SCAN=I/O Intr>, and also of records that use asynchronous completion.

=menu menuPriority

The number of priorities is set in various other places in the code too,
so adding new entries to this menu will probably break the IOC build.

=cut

menu(menuPriority) {
	choice(menuPriorityLOW,"LOW")
	choice(menuPriorityMEDIUM,"MEDIUM")
	choice(menuPriorityHIGH,"HIGH")
}
