This is a version of the BSD flex that has had its skeleton file munged in
order to force it to build lex programs that have all their functions and 
variables defined as static.

The file flex.skel.static is simply a copy of flex.skel that has been altered
to make all the components into static variables.

In order to be able to actually use the lex files produced by this flavor of
flex, you must #include them into your C programs.  Otherwise they will
be uncallable (all functions are static).  This is typical of lex programs
that are used by yacc programs anyway.

The scan.c file is actually the output of scan.l.DISTRIB when run through
itself, using the regular flex.skel skeleton with the -i option.

To regenerate scan.c, make sure you have a build of a working e_flex binary
somewhere, then in this directory (not an O.<arch> build directory):

% mv scan.l.DISTRIB scan.l
% /path/to/e_flex -Sflex.skel -8 -i scan.l
% mv lex.yy.c scan.c
% make

Then use the new binary to make sure it can build itself:

% O.<arch>/e_flex -Sflex.skel -8 -i scan.l
% mv lex.yy.c scan.c
% make

If that succeeds, don't forget to rename scan.l back again:

% mv scan.l scan.l.DISTRIB
