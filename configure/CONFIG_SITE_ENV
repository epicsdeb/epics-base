## Time service:
# EPICS_TZ
#       Local timezone rules for vxWorks and RTEMS. The value follows the Posix
#       TZ environment variable's Mm.n.d/h format (see the IBM link below for
#       details). If TZ hasn't already been set when the osdTime timeRegister()
#       C++ static constructor runs, this parameter will be copied into the TZ
#       environment variable. Once the OS clock has been synchronized to NTP the
#       routine tz2timezone() will be run to convert TZ into the TIMEZONE
#       variable format that VxWorks needs.
